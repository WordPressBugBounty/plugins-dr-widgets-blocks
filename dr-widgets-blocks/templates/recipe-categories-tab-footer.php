 * The template for displaying recipe content in archive.
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/dr-widgets-blocks/recipe-categories-tab-footer.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion WP Delicious will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
 *
 * @see     https://wpdelicious.com/docs-category/delisho/
 * @package DR_Widgets_Blocks/Templates
 * @version 1.0.0
